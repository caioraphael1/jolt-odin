## Jolt-Odin

- I'm experimenting with [amerkoleci/joltc](https://github.com/amerkoleci/joltc) interface for [jrouwe/JoltPhysics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics).
- Some binding files were generated with the help of [karl-zylinski/odin-c-bindgen](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/odin-c-bindgen).
- I'm currently testing on Windows x64.
- For a nice demo, check the examples folder.
